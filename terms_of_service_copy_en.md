PLEASE NOTE: SECTION 14 OF THIS AGREEMENT GOVERNS HOW DISAGREEMENTS AND CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND CHECKR CAN BE RESOLVED. THIS SECTION, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRES YOU AND CHECKR TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION.

You must be 16 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction in order to generate a background check and use the Services on our Site. If you are under 16 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, then you may not use the Services on our Site. If you are under 13 years old, this Site is not directed to children under 13 years old, and you may not provide personal information to us, make a purchase on the Site, or register on the Site.

By checking the box below and accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="https://checkr.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, as may be updated from time to time, (“Privacy Policy”), which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS OUR SITE.**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change and revise these Terms at any time by posting the changes on the Site. Any changes are effective immediately upon posting to the Site.

**1. Customers, Users and Use of Services**

These Terms apply to any and all Checkr customers and users of Checkr’s Services, including but not limited to individuals, small and large businesses, and nonprofit organizations, who utilize the Services (“Customers,” “you,” or “your”), as well as all others who access the Services, including but not limited to website visitors and users of affiliate websites which allow access to Checkr Services (“Users,” “you,” or “your”) including each User’s heirs, assigns and successors. If you use the Services on behalf of a business entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity, your acceptance of the Terms will be deemed an acceptance by that entity, and “you” and “your” herein shall refer to that entity.

Subject to the age restrictions outlined above, you may be able to submit information to us through your use of the Services. You agree to provide us with accurate information about yourself, including any information you may submit for background checks conducted about or requested by you. You further agree that your submission of such information is subject to our <a href="https://checkr.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.

In the Services, you may authorize Checkr and third-party partners to obtain background reports about you (also known as consumer reports or investigative consumer reports) from Checkr. If you provide such authorization, you understand and agree that 1) the party you authorize may obtain information about your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and/or mode of living, which can involve personal interviews with sources such as your neighbors, friends, or associates; 2) reports may include checks regarding your criminal history, credit history, eviction records, social security trace, motor vehicle records (“driving records”), drug screening, verification of your education or employment history or other background checks; and 3) any law enforcement agency, administrator, state or federal agency, institution, school or university (public or private), information service bureau, employer, or insurance company may furnish any and all background information requested by Checkr.

To the extent these Terms conflict with our <a href="https://checkr.com/customer-agreement/" target="_blank">Services Agreement</a>, the Services Agreement governs. If you enter into an agreement with Checkr providing different or additional terms regarding Checkr’s Services and there is a conflict between a provision in these Terms and a provision in such agreement, the latter takes precedence with respect to the provision in conflict.

**14. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY</span> — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND CHECKR CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND CHECKR TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT.**

**A. Agreement to Arbitrate**

In exchange for the benefits of the speedy, economical, and impartial dispute resolution procedure of arbitration, You and Checkr mutually agree to give up our right to resolve disagreements in a court of law by a judge or jury, and, as described below, agree to binding and final arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.

You and Checkr agree that this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and shall survive even after these Terms or any Services terminate.

**B. Claims Covered by Arbitration**

Other than the exceptions in Section 14.D, You and Checkr agree that any disagreement, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms (including its enforcement, breach, performance, interpretation, validity, or termination), or Your access to and/or use of the Services, or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Services (hereinafter, “Claims”), shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration to the fullest extent allowed by law.

**C. Delegation to Arbitrator**

If there is a disagreement about the arbitrability of any Claim (including questions about the scope, applicability, interpretation, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement), You and Checkr agree that this threshold disagreement shall be delegated to the arbitrator (not a court) and that the arbitrator shall have initial authority to resolve such threshold disagreements.

**D. Claims Not Covered by Arbitration**

This arbitration agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1) small claims actions demanding $10,000 or less brought on an individual basis and within a small claims court’s jurisdiction; and (2) applications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders, including those relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

**E. Class Action Waiver**

**Except as otherwise required under applicable law, You and Checkr agree to bring and resolve any Claims only on an individual basis, and not as a named-plaintiff or class member in any class or representative proceeding.** You and Checkr acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, or any other representative proceeding as to all Claims (hereinafter, “Class Action Waiver”). Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not preside over any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding, unless you and Checkr agree otherwise in writing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this arbitration agreement or the AAA Rules, specific disagreements about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If there is a final determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to certain claims brought on a class or representative basis, then those claims shall be severed from any remaining claims and may proceed in court, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to any remaining claims to the fullest extent possible.

**F. Arbitration Rules, Procedures, and Costs**

You and Checkr agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA. The arbitrator will apply the terms of this arbitration agreement and the applicable AAA rules, which are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1–800–778–7879. If You are an individual person, the arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. If You are not an individual person, but are an entity or company, the arbitrator shall apply the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.

*If You are an individual person and bring a claim solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less*: Checkr will agree to pay for any filing, administrative, or hearing fees charged by the AAA. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of Your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.

*If You are an individual person and bring a claim for monetary relief exceeding $10,000*: The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules will govern payment of administrative or hearing fees charged by the AAA, including limiting Your filing fee to $200. In addition, fee waivers or other forms of cost relief at the arbitrator’s discretion may be available. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of Your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.

*If You are not an individual person*: The AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules will govern payment of administrative or hearing fees charged by the AAA.

The arbitrator shall have the power to decide any motions, including dispositive or summary judgment motions, brought by any party to the arbitration. The arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim, including awards of attorney’s fees and costs, in accordance with the law or laws that apply to the Claim. The arbitrator shall provide in writing to the parties the basis for any award or decision. Judgment upon any award rendered in such arbitration will be binding and may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.

**G. Severability**

Except for the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.E, if any clause within this arbitration agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this arbitration agreement, and the remainder of the arbitration agreement will be given full force and effect.

**H. Opt-out**

If you are an individual person, You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to Checkr—clearly indicating your intent to opt out of this arbitration agreement and including the name, phone number, and email address associated with Your account—via email (arbitration@checkr.com) or U.S. Mail (Checkr, Inc., Legal Department, 1 Montgomery Street, Suite 2400, San Francisco, CA 94104). Your opt-out notice must be sent within 30 days of Your agreement to these Terms.

If You do not opt-out of this arbitration agreement within the 30-day period, You and Checkr shall be bound by the terms of this arbitration agreement in full. If You opt-out of this arbitration agreement within the 30-day period, it will not affect any other, previous, or future arbitration agreements that You may have with Checkr.

**I. Pre-Arbitration Notification and Negotiation Process**

Prior to initiating an arbitration, You and Checkr each agree to first attempt to negotiate an informal resolution of any Claims covered in Section 14.B. This pre-arbitration negotiation shall be initiated by providing written notice to the other party—including a brief written statement describing the name, address, and contact information of the notifying party, the facts giving rise to the Claim, and the relief requested. You must send such written notice to Checkr via email (legal@checkr.com) or U.S. Mail (Checkr, Inc., Legal Department, 1 Montgomery Street, Suite 2400, San Francisco, CA 94104); Checkr will send such written notice to the email address You have provided to Checkr.

During this pre-arbitration negotiation, all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties.

After a good faith effort to negotiate, if You or Checkr believe a Claim covered in Section 14.B cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.
